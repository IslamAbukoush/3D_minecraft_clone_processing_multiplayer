## ðŸ›  How to Run

### 1. Set Up the Node.js Server
- Clone and set up the server from the [Node.js WebSocket Server repository](https://github.com/IslamAbukoush/nodeJS_websocket).
- Follow the instructions provided there to get it running.

### 2. Configure the Game Sketch
- Open the sketch and locate the IP address configuration.  
- Replace the current IP with:
  - **Localhost**: `ws://localhost:3000/craft`
  - **LAN Multiplayer**: Obtain the IPv4 address of the host machine:
    - Run `ipconfig` (Windows) or an equivalent command on your OS.
    - Use the IPv4 address of the host as the WebSocket server address.
    - In the sketch paste the IPv4 address in the following format: `ws://[IPv4 HERE]:3000/craft`, e.g. `ws://192.168.0.1:3000/craft`.

### 3. Install Required Libraries
You might need to install some libraries for the sketch to work, such as the `websockets` library.  

To install a library:
1. Open Processing.
2. Navigate to **Sketch** -> **Import Library...** -> **Manage Libraries...**.
3. Search for the required library (e.g., `websockets`) and click **Install**.
